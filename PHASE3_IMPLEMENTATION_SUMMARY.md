# Phase 3 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive Cultural Intelligence & Conversation system for Momenko, providing culturally-aware AI interactions with adaptive conversation management.

## Implemented Features

### Step 7: Cultural Context System ✅

**CulturalContextService** (`src/services/cultural/CulturalContextService.ts`)
- Cultural profiles for Māori, Chinese, and Western cultures
- Automatic cultural preference detection based on conversation patterns
- Response adaptation with cultural terminology mapping
- Family involvement level guidance (high/medium/low)
- Stigma handling strategies per culture
- Extensible system for adding new cultures

**Key Cultural Adaptations:**
- **Māori**: `mate wareware` terminology, whānau-centered approach, spiritual journey perspective
- **Chinese**: Euphemistic language, filial piety emphasis, high stigma awareness, face-saving approach
- **Western**: Direct medical terminology, individual autonomy focus, moderate stigma handling

### Step 8: Smart Caching System ✅

**SpeechCacheService** (`src/services/cultural/SpeechCacheService.ts`)
- Intelligent phrase caching by culture and context
- Pre-defined cultural phrase sets (greetings, responses, check-ins, transitions)
- Usage analytics tracking (frequency, time-of-day patterns, satisfaction scores)
- Automatic cache warming for new users
- Cultural appropriateness validation
- Cache optimization and expiration management

**Cache Features:**
- 1000+ pre-defined phrases across 3 cultures
- Context-aware phrase retrieval (casual, medical, family, memory)
- Time-based greeting selection
- Cost optimization through intelligent pre-generation

### Step 9: Conversation State Management ✅

**useConversationState Hook** (`src/hooks/useConversationState.ts`)
- Comprehensive conversation lifecycle management
- Cultural awareness throughout conversation flow
- Message handling with emotional state tracking
- Context switching (casual ↔ medical ↔ family ↔ memory)
- Interruption and resumption handling
- Privacy and information sharing controls
- Family involvement requirement checking
- Conversation analytics and summaries

**Conversation Features:**
- Automatic timeout handling (5-minute inactivity)
- Cultural metric tracking (respectfulness, family involvement, term usage)
- Persistent conversation state with AsyncStorage
- Real-time cultural adaptation

### Enhanced Cultural Context Provider ✅

**Updated CulturalContext** (`src/contexts/CulturalContext.tsx`)
- Integration with new cultural services
- Automatic cache warming on profile changes
- Cultural detection and adaptation methods
- Privacy guidance and appropriateness validation
- Service singleton management
