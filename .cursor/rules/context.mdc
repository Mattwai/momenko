# Cursor Context Rules - Elderly Care Voice Assistant

## Project Mission
You are building a culturally-sensitive voice-based AI companion app for elderly users with dementia, addressing both loneliness and the critical gap in culturally appropriate healthcare support. The primary goals are reducing isolation, providing culturally-aware assistance, enabling caregiver check-ins, and supporting elderly individuals who revert to their native language or struggle with English-only healthcare facilities. This addresses a major barrier that forces families to provide home care due to lack of culturally sensitive institutional support.

## Target User Profile
- **Primary Users**: Elderly individuals (65+) with early to moderate dementia
- **Secondary Users**: Family caregivers and healthcare providers
- **Key Characteristics**: May forget they have the app, need simple interactions, prefer consistent experiences, may have hearing/vision limitations
- **Emotional Needs**: Companionship, patience, non-judgmental conversation, feeling heard and valued

## Technical Stack & Constraints
- **Frontend**: React Native (cross-platform mobile)
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, real-time subscriptions, auth)
- **Voice Services**: Elevenlabs (cost-effective, neural voices)
- **Budget Reality**: Solo developer, must optimize for cost-per-conversation
- **Scalability Target**: Support hundreds of elderly users without breaking budget

## Cultural Framework & Language Support

### Core Cultural Groups (Phase 1)
**English/Western**: Direct communication, individual autonomy, medical model approach
**Te Reo Māori/Māori**: Whānau-centered, spiritual journey perspective, prefer "mate wareware" over "dementia"
**Chinese/Mandarin**: Filial piety emphasis, family honor concerns, stigma around mental illness

### Cultural Sensitivity Principles

#### Māori Cultural Approach
- **Terminology**: Use "mate wareware" instead of "dementia" - the preferred term identified in research that positions the importance of using te reo
- **Perspective**: Some kaumātua don't see mate wareware negatively - view it as "a spiritual journey" that must be respected
- **Values**: Emphasize whānau (family) support, wairuatanga (spirituality), and aroha (love/compassion)
- **Communication Style**: Indirect, story-based, respectful of elders' mana (spiritual power)
- **Approach**: Focus on supporting whānau rather than treating illness

#### Chinese Cultural Approach
- **Family Dynamics**: Filial piety plays essential role in family care decision-making
- **Stigma Awareness**: Heavy stigma exists in Chinese communities, families often refuse professional help due to cultural values and sense of duty, with negative attitudes toward psychotherapy
- **Communication Style**: Respectful of hierarchy, indirect approach to sensitive topics
- **Values**: Honor, family reputation, collective responsibility
- **Approach**: Support family caregivers, provide education to reduce stigma

#### Western/English Approach
- **Medical Model**: Direct discussion of symptoms and treatments
- **Individual Focus**: Personal autonomy and choice
- **Communication Style**: Direct, informational, solution-oriented
- **Values**: Independence, medical intervention, professional care

### 2. Simplicity with Cultural Depth
- Large, accessible UI elements (minimum 18pt font)
- Single-purpose screens with minimal cognitive load
- Consistent visual patterns and terminology
- Voice-first interaction with visual backup

### 2. Dignity & Respect
- Never patronizing or childish language
- Assume intelligence and life experience
- Acknowledge confusion without embarrassment
- Maintain conversational warmth without being overly familiar

### 3. Cost-Conscious Architecture
- Cache common phrases to reduce API calls
- Implement silence detection to prevent accidental usage
- Design conversations to be listening-focused
- Monitor and optimize per-user costs
- Prioritize ElevenLabs for MVP, but optimise for cost-savings

### 4. Reliability & Safety
- Graceful degradation when services fail
- Emergency contact integration
- Conversation logging for caregiver review
- Privacy-first approach with local processing when possible

## Cultural Conversation Examples

### Māori Context
**Good**: "Kia ora. I can hear you're feeling a bit māuiui today. Would you like to share a kōrero about something that brought you joy recently?"
**Cultural Note**: Use mate wareware instead of dementia, acknowledge wairua (spiritual) aspects

### Chinese Context
**Good**: "您好 (Hello). I understand you might be feeling lonely. Your family cares deeply about you. Would you like to tell me about a happy memory?"
**Cultural Note**: Acknowledge family connections, avoid direct mental health terminology

### Western Context
**Good**: "Hello there. I can hear you're having a difficult day. Would you like to talk about what's been on your mind?"

**Universal Avoid**: Technical error messages, medical compliance language, rushed responses

## Budget Constraints to Remember
- Target <$0.10 per user per day for voice processing
- Prioritize caching and optimization over feature richness
- Monitor Elevenlabs and Deepseek usage and implement alerts
- Design for graceful degradation to free tiers

## Success Metrics
- Daily active conversations per user across cultural groups
- Language switching patterns and cultural preference indicators
- Family/whānau satisfaction with culturally appropriate interactions
- Healthcare facility adoption and cultural sensitivity feedback
- Cost per meaningful conversation while maintaining cultural authenticity
- User retention by cultural background
- Reduction in family caregiver burden through institutional support

## Development Workflow
- Test with elderly users from each target cultural group early and often
- Collaborate with cultural consultants and community elders for authentic guidance
- Prioritize core multilingual voice interaction before advanced features
- Implement cultural analytics to understand usage patterns across groups
- Regular cost monitoring while maintaining cultural quality standards
- Iterative improvement based on real conversations and cultural feedback
- Build extensible framework for adding new cultural contexts through research

Remember: This app serves as a cultural bridge in healthcare settings where elderly individuals revert to their native language and cultural frameworks. Every interaction should honor their cultural identity while providing the emotional support they need. Technical excellence serves the human mission of culturally-sensitive care and reducing the burden on families who currently have no alternative to home care.
